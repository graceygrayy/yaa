# 🎉 Fun Calculator 🧮

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator!** This is a playful, beginner-friendly Python program that lets users perform basic arithmetic operations—**addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**—on two numbers. Designed with humor and emojis to make math a little more exciting! 😄

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Takes two numeric inputs (supports decimals)
- ➕ Adds the numbers
- ➖ Subtracts the second number from the first
- ✖️ Multiplies the numbers
- ➗ Divides the first number by the second (⚠️ assumes no division by zero)

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter two numbers.
2. The program calculates:
   - Sum
   - Difference
   - Product
   - Quotient
3. The results are printed out in a fun, readable format.
